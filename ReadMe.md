## Beauty Pageant Tabulations

Back at <a href="https://web.facebook.com/ACLCCollegeIRIGA">ACLC College of Iriga</a>,
I was able to apply some development skills in real-life events such as beauty pageants.

My setup has always been the dead-simple local network through WIFI.
Laptops assigned to the board of judges are the clients connected to my local server,
which is the only thing I stare upon throughout the event... nothing else.

The more judges there were, the more fun and thrilling!

I went to several tabulations, but these are the only results I managed to save:
